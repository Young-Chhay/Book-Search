# Book Search Engine ðŸŒŸðŸŒŒ
## This Project is to  take starter code with a fully functioning Google Books API search engine built with a RESTful API, and refactor it to be a GraphQL API built with Apollo Server. The app was built using the MERN stack with a React front end, MongoDB database, and Node.js/Express.js server and API..

## Goal of this Project  
* Set up an Apollo Server to use GraphQL queries and mutations to fetch and modify data, replacing the existing RESTful API. 
* Modify the existing authentication middleware so that it works in the context of a GraphQL API.
* Create an Apollo Provider so that requests can communicate with an Apollo Server.
* Deploy the application to Heroku with a MongoDB database using MongoDB Atlas.
